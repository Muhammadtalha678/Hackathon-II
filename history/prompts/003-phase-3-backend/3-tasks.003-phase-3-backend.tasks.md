  Implementation tasks created for the Backend of Todo AI Chatbot (Phase-3). The tasks.md file includes:
  
  1. Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization, environment configuration)
  2. Phase 2: Foundational components (database models, utility functions, schemas, MCP tools interfaces)
  3. Phase 3: User Story 1 - AI Chat Interface (core chat functionality)
  4. Phase 4: User Story 2 - Conversation History Management (preserving context between sessions)
  5. Phase 5: User Story 3 - Task Operations via AI (natural language task management)
  6. Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (error handling, logging, security, monitoring)
  
  The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities are identified. The implementation strategy includes MVP scope focusing on User Story 1.
outcome: "SUCCESS: Tasks created at specs/003-phase-3-backend/tasks.md with 55 specific implementation tasks"
evaluation: "Complete task breakdown with all required phases, proper formatting, dependencies identified, and parallel execution opportunities noted. Ready for implementation phase."
