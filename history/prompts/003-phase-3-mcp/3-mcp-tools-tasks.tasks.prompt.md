# proceed with creating task add to use python for mcp tool and http stateless http= True

## Response

Generated comprehensive task list for MCP Task Management Tools implementation with the following structure:

1. **Phase 1**: Project Setup - Initialize project structure and foundational components
2. **Phase 2**: Foundational Components - Build models, storage, and service layers
3. **Phase 3**: User Story 1 (P1) - Task Creation functionality
4. **Phase 4**: User Story 2 (P1) - Task Retrieval functionality
5. **Phase 5**: User Story 3 (P2) - Task Management (complete, update, delete)
6. **Phase 6**: Security & Validation - User isolation and input validation
7. **Phase 7**: Polish & Cross-Cutting - Documentation, type hints, and final validation

The task list includes 57 specific tasks (T001-T077) with proper labeling for user stories ([US1], [US2], [US3]), parallel execution opportunities ([P]), and clear file paths. Tasks follow TDD approach with unit and integration tests planned throughout the implementation. The implementation will use Python with stateless HTTP operations as requested, focusing on user isolation and data integrity.

Dependencies and execution order are clearly defined, with parallel execution opportunities identified to optimize development speed while maintaining proper sequencing of dependent components.
